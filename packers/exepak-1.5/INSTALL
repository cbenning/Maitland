EXEPAK can be simply compiled by typing 'make.'

After you have built the main exepak binary, you don't need to keep any of
the other files around for it to work properly.

Note to Linux rootdisk makers: EXEPAK may be extremely useful in helping the
creators of Linux distributions pack more useful utilities onto rootdisks.
However, if you use exepak for a rootdisk and not using the asm stub
(unlikely), be sure the exepak you use has it's stub linked against
whatever flavour of libc you use on the rootdisk if you use some kind of
special libc.  Many rootdisks use 'lite' variants of libc that take up less
space but are not compatible with the standard version of libc.  If you use
the normal libc, don't worry about it. Also be sure your rootdisk creates a
/tmp directory big enough somewhere (like a tmpfs).
