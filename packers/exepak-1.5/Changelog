Version 1.5:
   - fixed a compile problem with gcc-3.2.3
   - removed an unused string
   - the stub is 1113 bytes

Feb 24 2005
Version 1.4:
   - fixed permission of the temp dir

Jan 10 2005
Version 1.3:
   - instead of a temp file a temp dir is being used under "/tmp" containing
     a file with the same name as the calling program. Useful for the
     programs/scripts who want to know by what name they are called
   - the random bytes needed for the directory's name are read from
     "/dev/urandom"
   - the proc filesystem is no longer used which gives more flexibility and
     a bigger decompression speed.
   - the compressed file's mode is hardcoded at compression time
   - scripts can now be compressed
   - the stub is 1128 bytes long

Version 1.2:
   - assembler stub (using gas)
   - removed support for encryption and setuid/setgid binaries
   - replaced LZO with UCL (better compression)
   - simplified the build process by smartening up the makefiles ;-)
   - using sstrip - makes the stub much smaller
   - updated and renamed "HOW_TO_COMPILE" to "INSTALL"
   - added -d option as an alias to -x
   - uncompressible blocks are copied unchanged

Version 1.1:
   - Fixed a bug that caused EXEPAK to crash when testing if a binary was
     already compressed on some systems
   - Updated LZO to version 1.01
   - Changed command interface to be more like a normal compression program
   - Added -e "encryption" option
   - Added -t option to test if files are compressed
   - Added -x option to extract compressed executables
   - Got rid of ^dc- option to compressed programs-- exepak binary does
     extraction now with the -x switch
   - Now handles setuid/setgid binaries
   - Will not attempt to compress non-executable files or directories
   - Will not attempt to compress ELF shared libraries
   - Minimum blocksize set to 16k
   - Saves original file attributes, times, and owners
   - Added progress meter during compression

Version 1.0:
   - First version
